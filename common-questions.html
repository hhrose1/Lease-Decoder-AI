    <!-- SECTION: BEFORE YOU SIGN -->
    <h3>Before You Sign a Lease</h3>
    <p><strong>What should I look for before signing a lease?</strong><br>
      Confirm what you are responsible for and what your landlord must provide, including:
      rent amount and schedule, utilities, late-fee policy, security deposit rules, guest/pet/parking rules,
      maintenance responsibilities, mold/pest responsibilities, and early termination options.
      Request all agreements in writing before signing.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need a walkthrough? What should I check?</strong><br>
      Yes — inspect everything before move-in and document concerns with photos. Look for:
      leaks, soft drywall, musty smells (mold), pests, broken locks or windows, and malfunctioning appliances.
      Email your landlord photos the same day for a paper trail.</p>

    <p><strong>Should I ask existing tenants about the property?</strong><br>
      Yes. Ask about maintenance responsiveness, safety at night, pests, cleanliness, noise levels,
      and whether management is easy to contact. If multiple tenants report the same issue — take it seriously.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need renters insurance?</strong><br>
      Usually required — always recommended. Protects your belongings and liability.
      Typical cost: <strong>$10–20/month</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Can a landlord check my credit? What if it’s low?</strong><br>
      Yes. If credit is low, you can offer alternatives like a co-signer, proof of income, or savings.
      Each landlord sets their own acceptance criteria.</p>

    <!-- SECTION: AFTER MOVE-IN -->
    <h3>Once You Move In</h3>
    <p><strong>How should I request repairs?</strong><br>
      Always submit requests in writing (email is best) with photos and a clear timeline.
      Keep copies of every message and response.</p>

    <p><strong>What makes a rental “unsafe” or “uninhabitable”?</strong><br>
      Anything that impacts health or safety can qualify — major leaks, lack of heat or water, severe mold,
      pests, faulty wiring, or broken doors/windows that prevent secure entry.</p>

    <!-- SECTION: RENT & DEPOSITS -->
    <h3>Rent, Fees & Deposits</h3>
    <p><strong>What is rent escrow?</strong><br>
      A legal process where tenants pay rent to the court instead of the landlord when major repair issues
      are ignored. <u>Do not withhold rent without legal guidance</u> — laws differ by state.</p>

    <!-- SECTION: ROOMMATES & NEIGHBORS -->
    <h3>Roommates & Neighbors</h3>
    <p><strong>What if my roommate breaks the lease?</strong><br>
      You may still be financially responsible. Consider a written roommate agreement and communicate lease
      terms clearly before signing.</p>

    <!-- SECTION: LEASE RENEWAL / MOVING OUT -->
    <h3>Lease Changes, Renewals & Moving Out</h3>
    <p><strong>Can I break my lease early?</strong><br>
      Usually — but often with fees unless state protections apply (safety concerns, DV, military orders, etc.).
      Ask whether the landlord allows replacement tenants and what notice is required.</p>

    <p><strong>How do leases typically renew?</strong><br>
      Options include:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Automatic renewal</strong> — continues unless you give notice</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed-term renewal</strong> — usually new 12-month contract</li>
        <li><strong>Month-to-month</strong> — more flexible, but rent may change</li>
      </ul>
      Always ask about notice deadlines and expected rent increases.</p>

    <!-- SECTION: EVICTION & LEGAL HELP -->
    <h3>Evictions & Legal Rights</h3>
    <p><strong>What is eviction?</strong><br>
      A court-ordered process for removing a tenant. You must receive written notice and a court date.
      Landlords <u>cannot</u> lock you out or remove belongings without a court order.</p>

    <p><strong>Where can I get help?</strong><br>
      Tenant legal organizations, university legal clinics, and housing advocacy groups.

    <!-- SECTION: BEST PRACTICES -->
    <h3>General Best Practices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep all communication in writing</li>
      <li>Photograph and document all issues</li>
      <li>Ask for clarification before signing anything</li>
      <li>Seek help early — problems worsen when delayed</li>
    </ul>
